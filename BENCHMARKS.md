## Detailed Analysis

### In-Distribution Performance

Both models achieve **perfect performance** (100% accuracy, perplexity 1.00) on in-distribution data, as expected. RecursiveInfinigram is slightly slower (3.92ms vs 1.46ms) due to transformation overhead, but this is negligible in practice.

### OOD: Case Changes

**Scenario**: Input has random case changes (e.g., "ThE QuIcK BroWN")

**Results**:
- Vanilla struggles with case variations (52.5% accuracy)
- RecursiveInfinigram handles them well via CaseNormalizer (74.5% accuracy)
- **22 percentage point improvement** in accuracy
- **36% reduction** in perplexity

**Why it works**: CaseNormalizer transforms "ThE QuIcK" → "the quick" before querying, finding matches in the original corpus.

### OOD: Typos

**Scenario**: Input has 1-2 character typos (e.g., "the qwick brown")

**Results**:
- Vanilla has some resilience due to partial matches (76.5% accuracy)
- RecursiveInfinigram improves via EditDistanceTransformer (82.5% accuracy)
- **6 percentage point improvement** in accuracy
- **10% reduction** in perplexity

**Why it works**: EditDistanceTransformer detects corpus words within edit distance 1, suggesting "qwick" → "quick" correction.

### OOD: Case + Typos (Hardest)

**Scenario**: Combined case changes and typos (e.g., "ThE qwIcK BroWN")

**Results**:
- Vanilla struggles significantly (40.5% accuracy)
- RecursiveInfinigram shows strong robustness (61.0% accuracy)
- **20.5 percentage point improvement** in accuracy
- **40% reduction** in perplexity

**Why it works**: Multiple transformers can chain together:
1. CaseNormalizer: "ThE qwIcK" → "the qwick"
2. EditDistanceTransformer: "the qwick" → "the quick"
3. Result: Successfully recovers original context

## Performance Trade-offs

### Speed

RecursiveInfinigram is **slower** than vanilla due to transformation overhead:

- In-Distribution: 2.7x slower (3.92ms vs 1.46ms)
- OOD: Case Changes: 78x slower (96.12ms vs 1.23ms)
- OOD: Typos: 21x slower (20.44ms vs 0.99ms)
- OOD: Case + Typos: 61x slower (71.33ms vs 1.17ms)

**Why**: RecursiveInfinigram tries multiple transformations, each requiring:
- Transformation generation (corpus inspection)
- New suffix array queries
- Scoring and ranking

**Mitigation strategies**:
- Cache transformation results
- Limit transformation depth
- Use conservative scorer when corpus coverage is high
- Prune low-scoring transformations early

### Memory

RecursiveInfinigram has similar memory footprint to vanilla:
- Same suffix array
- Additional: transformation cache (~KB)
- Additional: scorer state (~bytes)

## When to Use Each Model

### Use Vanilla Infinigram When:
- Input is in-distribution (matches training corpus well)
- Speed is critical
- Corpus coverage is very high
- You don't expect typos, case variations, or paraphrasing

### Use RecursiveInfinigram When:
- Input may have typos or spelling errors
- Input may have case variations
- Input may use synonyms not in corpus
- Robustness is more important than speed
- Working with OOD data (new domains, user-generated content)

## Scoring System Impact

The TransformationScorer uses multi-factor weighting:

1. **Match Length** (40%): Longer suffix matches are better
2. **Match Frequency** (20%): More common patterns are more confident
3. **Transformation Quality** (30%): Different transformers have different reliability
4. **Depth Penalty** (10%): Fewer transformations are better

### Transformer Reliability Weights
- Case normalization: 0.99 (very reliable)
- Typo correction: 0.95 (reliable)
- Synonym replacement: 0.85 (less reliable, meaning can shift)

This weighting ensures that:
- Original context (no transformations) scores highest when it has good matches
- Case-normalized contexts score almost as high as originals
- Synonym-based transformations are used cautiously

## Conclusion

RecursiveInfinigram demonstrates **significant improvements** on out-of-distribution data:

- **+22% accuracy** on case variations
- **+6% accuracy** on typos
- **+20.5% accuracy** on combined challenges
- **Up to 40% perplexity reduction** on hard OOD scenarios

The trade-off is **higher latency** (2-78x slower), but this is acceptable for many applications where robustness is critical.

The transformation-based approach successfully handles:
- ✅ Case variations
- ✅ Typos and spelling errors
- ✅ Synonyms (via WordNet)
- ✅ Multiple simultaneous transformations

## Running Benchmarks

```bash
python3 examples/run_benchmark.py
```

To run on your own corpus:

```python
from infinigram.evaluation import BenchmarkSuite
from infinigram.infinigram import Infinigram
from infinigram.recursive import RecursiveInfinigram, CaseNormalizer

# Your corpus
corpus = b"your training data here"

# Create models
vanilla = Infinigram(corpus)
recursive = RecursiveInfinigram(corpus, transformers=[CaseNormalizer()])

# Create benchmark suite
suite = BenchmarkSuite(corpus)

# Create test datasets
in_dist = suite.create_in_distribution_test(num_samples=100)
ood_case = suite.create_ood_test(['case'], num_samples=100)

# Compare
results = suite.compare_models(
    models={"Vanilla": vanilla, "Recursive": recursive},
    test_datasets={"In-Dist": in_dist, "OOD": ood_case}
)

# Print results
from infinigram.evaluation import print_comparison_table
print_comparison_table(results)
```

## Test Coverage

The evaluation framework has comprehensive test coverage:

- **20 evaluation tests** (test_evaluation.py)
- **33 scoring tests** (test_scoring.py)
- **43 recursive tests** (test_recursive.py + others)
- **Total: 96 tests passing**

## Future Work

Potential improvements:

1. **Faster transformations**: Cache corpus-guided transformations
2. **Better scoring**: Learn weights from validation data
3. **More transformers**: Stemming, lemmatization, abbreviations
4. **Beam pruning**: Prune low-scoring transformations early
5. **Parallel transformations**: Try transformations in parallel
6. **Context-aware synonyms**: Use context to disambiguate word senses
